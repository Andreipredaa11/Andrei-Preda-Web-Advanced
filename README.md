# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project allows players to enjoy the popular card game of Blackjack directly in their web browser. Players can enter their name, play Blackjack against the dealer, and track their wins and losses over time.

## Features

- **Player Name Entry:** Players can enter their name to personalize their gaming experience.
- **Game Statistics:** Tracks the number of wins and losses for each player using browser local storage.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can hit or stand during their turn, with the game dynamically updating the interface to reflect the current state.
- **Responsive Design:** The game interface is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. **Getting Started:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. **Enter Your Name:** Input your name in the provided field and click "Start Game" to begin.
3. **Gameplay:** Use the "Hit" button to draw additional cards or the "Stand" button to end your turn.
4. **Winning:** Reach a total value of 21 without busting to win the round.
5. **Persistence:** Your wins and losses are saved locally, allowing you to track your progress over time.

### Functions
- [X] Elementen selecteren: Used to select HTML elements for manipulation (e.g., `document.getElementById()`).
- [X] Elementen manipuleren: Manipulates selected HTML elements to update game interface (e.g., updating text content, enabling/disabling buttons).
- [X] Event aan een element koppelen: Attaches event listeners to HTML elements to handle user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons).
- [X] Formulier valideren: Validates form input by checking player name field before starting the game.
- [X] Gebruiken van een constante: Defines constants for suits and values of cards in the game.
- [X] Gebruiken van template literals: Uses template literals to dynamically generate messages displayed in the game interface.
- [X] Destructuring: Destructures object properties in functions like `getCardValue()` to extract card values.
- [X] Spread & Rest operator: Uses spread operator in functions like `shuffleDeck()` to create a shuffled deck.
- [X] Iteration over een array: Iterates over arrays in functions like `renderHand()` to display player and dealer hands.
- [X] Arrow function: Uses arrow functions throughout the code for defining functions.
- [X] Callback function: Utilizes callback functions in event listeners to handle user actions (e.g., hitting or standing in the game).
- [X] Promise: Uses promises in functions like `fetchStats()` to handle asynchronous fetching of game statistics from local storage.
- [X] Consumer methods: Employs consumer methods like `then()` to handle promises and retrieve data fetched from local storage.
- [X] Async & Await: Uses `async` and `await` keywords in the self-executing function to wait for asynchronous initialization tasks.
- [X] Self executing function: Wraps the entire script in a self-executing function to encapsulate variables and prevent global scope pollution.
- [X] Fetch om data op te halen: Uses `localStorage.getItem()` method to fetch game statistics from the browser's local storage.
- [X] JSON manipuleren en weergeven: Parses and stringifies JSON data when saving and retrieving game statistics from local storage.
- [X] Basis CSS Animatie: Applies basic CSS animations to cards when they are rendered on the screen.
- [X] Gebruiken van een flexbox of CSS grid: Utilizes Flexbox for layout styling in the game interface.
- [X] Gebruik van LocalStorage: Utilizes the browser's `localStorage` object to persist game statistics across sessions.

Here's where elements are selected in your code:

javascript
Copiază codul
// Selectors
const playerHandElement = document.getElementById("player-hand");
const dealerHandElement = document.getElementById("dealer-hand");
const hitButton = document.getElementById("hit");
const standButton = document.getElementById("stand");
const resetButton = document.getElementById("reset");
const messageElement = document.getElementById("message");
const playerForm = document.getElementById("player-form");
const playerNameInput = document.getElementById("player-name");
const playerInfoElement = document.getElementById("player-info");
const statsElement = document.getElementById("stats");
const getStatsButton = document.getElementById("get-stats");
In these lines, various HTML elements are selected using document.getElementById(). These elements are then stored in variables for later use in the code. This demonstrates the use of "Elementen selecteren" (Selecting elements) in your code.

If i find images for the cards can i use them depending what i generated?
ChatGPT
Yes, absolutely! Using images for the cards can greatly enhance the visual appeal and user experience of your Blackjack game. You can dynamically generate the URLs for the card images based on the cards generated in your game.

Here's how you can integrate card images into your project:

Find or Create Card Images: You can find card images online or create your own. Ensure that the images are consistent in size and style.

Organize the Images: Once you have the card images, organize them in a directory within your project. You might want to structure the directory based on the card suits or values for easier retrieval.

Generate Image URLs: In your JavaScript code, you can dynamically generate the URLs for the card images based on the suits and values of the cards. For example, if you have card images named heart_2.png, diamond_10.png, etc., you can construct the URLs accordingly.

Display the Images: Update your renderHand() function or wherever you're rendering the cards to use the generated image URLs. You can set the src attribute of <img> elements to the generated URLs to display the card images.

Styling: Adjust the CSS styles as needed to ensure that the card images are displayed appropriately within your game interface. You may need to adjust the size, position, and alignment of the card images to fit your design.

By integrating card images into your project, you can create a more immersive and visually appealing Blackjack game experience for your players. Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific aspect of this integration!

Help me please, lets say i found the url for each card in the game.
ChatGPT
Sure, if you have the URLs for each card in the game, you can dynamically generate and display the card images in your project. Here's how you can do it:

Store Card Image URLs: Store the URLs for each card in your JavaScript code. You can organize them in an object where the keys represent the card values and suits, and the values represent the corresponding image URLs. For example:
javascript
Copiază codul
const cardImages = {
  "2 of Hearts": "url_for_2_of_hearts_image",
  "3 of Hearts": "url_for_3_of_hearts_image",
  // Add URLs for other cards...
};
Render Card Images: Modify your renderHand() function to use the card image URLs when rendering the cards. You can create <img> elements dynamically and set their src attribute to the corresponding image URL. For example:
javascript
Copiază codul
const renderHand = (hand, element) => {
  element.innerHTML = "";
  hand.forEach((card) => {
    const cardElement = document.createElement("div");
    cardElement.className = "card";
    const imageElement = document.createElement("img");
    imageElement.src = cardImages[`${card.value} of ${card.suit}`];
    cardElement.appendChild(imageElement);
    element.appendChild(cardElement);

Styling: Adjust your CSS styles to ensure that the card images are displayed properly within your game interface. You may need to adjust the size, position, and alignment of the card images to fit your design.
By following these steps, you'll be able to dynamically generate and display the card images in your Blackjack game based on the URLs you found. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions!

can you provide me please with all the cards? for that array
ChatGPT
Sure, here's an example of how you could define an object containing the URLs for card images for a standard deck of 52 cards:

javascript
Copiază codul
const cardImages = {
  "2 of Hearts": "url_for_2_of_hearts_image",
  "3 of Hearts": "url_for_3_of_hearts_image",
  "4 of Hearts": "url_for_4_of_hearts_image",
  "5 of Hearts": "url_for_5_of_hearts_image",
  "6 of Hearts": "url_for_6_of_hearts_image",
  "7 of Hearts": "url_for_7_of_hearts_image",
  "8 of Hearts": "url_for_8_of_hearts_image",
  "9 of Hearts": "url_for_9_of_hearts_image",
  "10 of Hearts": "url_for_10_of_hearts_image",
  "J of Hearts": "url_for_J_of_hearts_image",
  "Q of Hearts": "url_for_Q_of_hearts_image",
  "K of Hearts": "url_for_K_of_hearts_image",
  "A of Hearts": "url_for_A_of_hearts_image",

  // Similarly for other suits
};
You would need to replace the placeholders (url_for_2_of_hearts_image, etc.) with the actual URLs for the corresponding card images. You can find card images online or create them yourself. Ensure that the image URLs are correct and accessible.

This example includes only the cards from the Hearts suit. You would need to add entries for the cards from the other suits (Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades) in a similar fashion.

Once you have the object cardImages defined with the URLs for all 52 cards, you can use it to dynamically render the card images in your game. Let me know if you need further assistance!

  "A of Spades": "url_for_A_of_spades_image",
};
Replace the placeholder URLs (url_for_2_of_hearts_image, etc.) with the actual URLs for the corresponding card images. You would need to have images for all 52 cards, covering all suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades) and all values (2 through Ace).

Once you have this object defined with the URLs for all 52 cards, you can use it to dynamically render the card images in your game. Let me know if you need further assistance!

the images are actually local
ChatGPT
Got it! If the images are stored locally in your project directory, you can still use them by specifying the relative paths to the image files. Here's how you could define the object containing the relative paths for the local card images:

javascript
Copiază codul
const cardImages = {
  "2 of Hearts": "./images/2_of_hearts.png",
  "3 of Hearts": "./images/3_of_hearts.png",
  "4 of Hearts": "./images/4_of_hearts.png",
  // and so on for the rest of the cards...
};
In this example, the images for each card are assumed to be located in an "images" directory within your project directory. Adjust the paths accordingly if your images are located in a different directory.

Once you have this object defined with the relative paths for all 52 cards, you can use it to dynamically render the card images in your game. Let me know if you need further assistance!

they are oversized i need them to fit automacly on the div they belong to
ChatGPT
To ensure that the card images fit automatically within the div they belong to, you can apply CSS styles to the image elements to control their dimensions. Here's how you can do it:

Set Max Width and Height: You can set a max-width and max-height property on the image elements to ensure that they don't exceed a certain size. This will allow the images to scale down proportionally if they are larger than the specified dimensions.

Width and Height Auto: Setting the width and height properties to auto will allow the images to adjust their size automatically based on the content of the div they belong to.

Here's an example of how you can apply these styles to the image elements in your render function:

javascript
Copiază codul
const renderHand = (hand, element) => {
  element.innerHTML = "";
  hand.forEach((card) => {
    const cardElement = document.createElement("div");
    cardElement.className = "card";

    const imageElement = document.createElement("img");
    imageElement.src = cardImages[`${card.value} of ${card.suit}`];
    imageElement.className = "card-image"; // Add a class for styling

    cardElement.appendChild(imageElement);
    element.appendChild(cardElement);
  });
};
And in your CSS file, you can define styles for the .card-image class:

css
Copiază codul
.card-image {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
}
With these styles applied, the card images will fit automatically within the div they belong to, scaling down proportionally if they are larger than the dimensions of the div. Adjust the max-width and max-height properties as needed to control the maximum size of the card images.

they still do not fit 100%
ChatGPT
If the card images are not fitting 100% within the div despite setting max-width: 100%; and max-height: 100%;, there might be other CSS properties affecting their size. Here are a few additional steps you can take to ensure the images fit correctly:

Inspect the Parent Element: Make sure there are no other CSS rules affecting the size of the parent div containing the card images. If the parent div has fixed dimensions or padding, it may affect the size of the images.

Check Box Sizing: Verify that the box-sizing property of the parent and child elements is not affecting the size calculation. Setting box-sizing: border-box; ensures that padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height.

Reset Default Margins and Padding: Some browsers apply default margins and padding to elements. You can reset these to zero to avoid unintended spacing around the images.

Use the Object Fit Property: If the images are still not fitting correctly, you can try using the object-fit property in CSS to control how the content of the image is resized to fit its container. For example, you can set object-fit: contain; to ensure that the entire image fits within the container without distortion.

Here's an updated example applying these suggestions:

css
Copiază codul
.card-image {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  object-fit: contain; /* Adjust this property as needed */
}
By inspecting the parent element, ensuring proper box sizing, resetting default margins and padding, and using the object-fit property, you should be able to ensure that the card images fit correctly within their container divs. Let me know if you need further assistance!

can you maybe add a nicer css to it? maybe some animation too
ChatGPT
Certainly! Adding CSS animations and improving the styling can enhance the visual appeal of your card images. Here's an example of how you can add some basic styling and animations to the card images:

css
Copiază codul
.card-image {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  object-fit: contain;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add transition for smooth animation */
}

.card-image:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Scale up the image on hover */
}

/* Optional: Add additional styling for the card container */
.card {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  margin: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Ensure that the image doesn't overflow */
  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add transition for box shadow */
}

.card:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increase box shadow on hover */
}
In this CSS:

Each card image (card-image) will have a transition effect on the transform property, making the image smoothly scale up when hovered over.
The :hover pseudo-class is used to apply the scaling effect when the user hovers over the card image.
The .card class applies some basic styling to the card container, such as a border, border-radius, and box-shadow.
The .card:hover class increases the box-shadow when the user hovers over the card container, giving it a slight lift effect.
Feel free to adjust the CSS properties and animations to better fit the style of your project. Let me know if you need further customization or assistance!

not the card but the rest of the buttons
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of how you can add some nicer CSS styles and animations to the buttons and other elements in your game interface:

css
Copiază codul
/* Styles for buttons and form */
button,
input[type="text"] {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out, transform 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

button:hover,
input[type="text"]:focus {
  background-color: #005500;
}

button:active,
input[type="text"]:focus {
  transform: scale(0.95);
}

/* Additional styles for the controls */
.controls {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Styles for message and stats elements */
#message,
#stats {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Optional: Add animation for message element */
@keyframes slideIn {
  from {
    transform: translateY(-20px);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

#message {
  animation: slideIn 0.5s ease forwards;
}
In this CSS:

Buttons and input fields have padding, border-radius, and a transition effect for background color and scaling.
When hovered over or focused (in the case of input fields), the background color changes to a darker shade and the buttons shrink slightly to provide visual feedback.
The .controls class ensures that the game controls are evenly spaced and have some margin at the bottom.
The text-align: center; property is applied to the message and stats elements for center alignment.
The message element (#message) has an animation (slideIn) that slides it in from the top and fades in when the game starts or when a message is displayed.
Feel free to adjust the styles and animations according to your preferences. Let me know if you need further customization or assistance!
